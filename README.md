# Computer Store

This assignment asks you to model a simple object-oriented computer store. It is divided into 3 parts. Each part has it's own folder, and a description of what to do. To keep your organised, it makes sense to keep the `.java` files in each folder, although you may copy code if it is reused.

The assignment parts are as follows:

- [Part 1: Basics](part-1-basics) - create the `Computer` class and model its components
- [Part 2: Store](part-2-store) - create the `ComputerStore` class to model a collection of `Computer` instances
- [Part 3: Flexibility](part-3-flexibility) - modify the `Computer` class to allow multiple configurations of components

You should aim to develop a solution that is:
- Neat
- Documented
- Tested
